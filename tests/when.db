var const health = 10!

when (health == 0) { // The example in the spec has `health = 0` but I have no idea how to implement that as a comparison
   print("You lose")! // Should print second
}

print("Changing health to 0")! // Should print first
health = 0!

====================

class Player {
   var const health = 100!
}

const const player = new Player()!

when (player.health == 0) {
   print("Player loses")!
}

print("Changing player health to 0")!
player.health = 0!
